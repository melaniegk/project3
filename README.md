A machine learning project focuses on crop management domain. An automatic plant watering system was done through a predictive analysis. Dataset was acquired from Kaggle platform, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelakurthisudheer/dataset-for-predicting-watering-the-plants,  in which plants condition such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc were taken into account to build a predictive model to predict the watering of crops. A prototype of the application was portrayed using Figma which can be viewed here.
